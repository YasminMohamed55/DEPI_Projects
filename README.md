 ### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the Adventure Works Sales Analysis project, data cleaning and preparation were essential steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data before performing analysis. The steps taken included:

1- Handling Missing Data:
- Identified and addressed missing or null values in key columns such as Order Date, Product Name, and Quantity. Missing values were either filled with appropriate default values or removed based on the data context.

2- Data Type Conversion:
- Ensured correct data types were assigned to columns, for example, converting dates to the proper date format and numerical data to float or integer types for calculations.

3- Removing Duplicates:
- Identified and removed duplicate rows that could skew analysis, particularly focusing on order records that may have been inadvertently repeated.
Outlier Detection:
Checked for outliers in data such as extreme values for sales revenue or quantity, and either corrected or excluded these outliers depending on the context.

4- Standardizing Data:
- Standardized text fields like product names and regions to ensure consistency across the dataset, eliminating any discrepancies due to capitalization, spelling, or formatting issues.

5- Date Formatting:
- Cleaned date columns to ensure consistency and correct interpretation in trend analysis, making sure all date formats were aligned.

6- Creating New Columns:
- Derived new columns such as profit margins, sales totals, and percentage changes to enhance the analysis and make the data more actionable.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The steps taken included:
- Summary Statistics: Generated basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for key metrics such as Revenue, Quantity, and Profit.
- Univariate Analysis: Analyzed categorical variables like Product Category and Customer Segment to understand the distribution of sales and customer types.
- Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between Revenue and Quantity Sold, as well as Profit, to identify correlations.
- Visualizations: Created bar charts and time-series plots to examine product performance, regional sales, and seasonal trends.
- Outlier Detection: Identified outliers in metrics like Revenue and Quantity to examine potential data errors or extreme values.
- Geographical and Temporal Insights: Mapped sales by region and analyzed sales trends across different time periods to identify peak months and high-performing regions.

Key insights from the EDA included identifying top-performing products, profitable customer segments, and seasonal trends, which set the foundation for more detailed analysis and forecasting.
