3- Calculated Metrics: Added derived columns such as "Total Revenue" and "Net Profit" for deeper financial insights.

4- Checked for Duplicates: Removed any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

5- Validated Data Accuracy: Verified consistency of numerical values for pricing, discounts, and profit margins to avoid anomalies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1- Category and Sub-Category Analysis:
Identified product categories and sub-categories contributing most to sales, revenue, and profit.
Highlighted the top 5 sub-categories driving maximum performance metrics.

2- Trend Analysis:
Analyzed sales, revenue, and profit trends over time (monthly basis).
Visualized growth patterns and seasonal variations using line charts.

3- Customer Segment Analysis:
Explored the distribution of customer segments and their impact on sales, revenue, and profit.
Calculated the segment with the highest number of orders and average order size.

4- Regional Performance:
Evaluated total sales, revenue, and net profit by region.
Highlighted regions with the best and worst performance metrics.

5- Insights Generation:
Uncovered actionable insights like high-performing segments and sub-categories to optimize sales strategies.

###  Results/Findings

The analysis provided insights into key performance metrics for sales, revenue, and profitability across customer segments and regions. Significant trends over time were identified, including the drivers of revenue and profit. Additionally, customer segments with the highest order volumes and average order sizes were highlighted, offering actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

### Recommendations

1- Focus on High-Performing Segments: Prioritize marketing and personalized offers for customer segments driving the highest revenue and profit.

2- Optimize Regional Strategies: Invest resources in regions with the strongest sales performance while exploring growth opportunities in underperforming areas.

3- Enhance Product Availability: Ensure consistent stock levels for top-selling products to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.

4- Analyze Seasonal Trends: Use the identified sales trends over time to plan promotions and inventory strategies during peak periods.

5- Increase Average Order Value: Develop targeted campaigns to encourage customers in segments with lower average order sizes to purchase higher-value products.

6-Profit Margin Optimization: Focus on products and regions with high profitability while reducing costs associated with lower-margin items.
